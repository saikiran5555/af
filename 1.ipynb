    "In the context of artificial neural networks, an activation function is a mathematical operation applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network layer. It helps to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs. It adds non-linear properties to the network, enabling it to approximate complex functions and make better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of activation functions commonly used in neural networks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid: Maps the input to a range between 0 and 1, useful in binary classification tasks.\n",
    "Hyperbolic tangent (tanh): Similar to the sigmoid function but maps input to a range between -1 and 1.\n",
    "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): Returns 0 for negative inputs and the input itself for positive inputs, widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "Leaky ReLU: Similar to ReLU but allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs, addressing the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "Softmax: Used in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks, normalizes the output into a probability distribution.\n",
    "Others like Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU), and Swish.\n",
    "The choice of activation function depends on the nature of the problem being solved and the characteristics of the data. Different activation functions have different properties and can affect the training process and performance of the neural network."
