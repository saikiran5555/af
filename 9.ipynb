    "Saturation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sigmoid and tanh functions saturate at extreme input values, meaning that they approach their minimum and maximum values, leading to vanishing gradients. However, tanh saturates faster than sigmoid, as its output range is more limited.\n",
    "Gradient Magnitude:\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradients of the tanh function are higher than those of the sigmoid function, especially around the origin. This can help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem to some extent, making tanh a preferred choice in some cases.\n",
    "Output Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanh outputs are zero-centered, which can aid in optimizing models and making the optimization process more stable compared to sigmoid functions, which are not zero-centered."
