    "Using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function over the sigmoid function offers several benefits, especially in the context of training deep neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoids Vanishing Gradient Problem: ReLU addresses the vanishing gradient problem better than sigmoid. The gradient of ReLU is 1 for positive inputs, which prevents the gradient from vanishing as the network gets deeper. This leads to more stable and efficient training, especially in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse Activation: ReLU activation provides sparse activations, meaning that only a subset of neurons is activated for any given input. This sparsity can lead to more efficient computations and better generalization, as the network focuses on important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster Computation: The ReLU function is computationally cheaper than sigmoid because it involves simple thresholding operations. This makes ReLU faster to compute, especially in large networks with many neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoids Saturation: ReLU does not suffer from saturation in the same way as sigmoid. For positive inputs, ReLU outputs the input itself, avoiding saturation and enabling faster learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better Gradient Propagation: ReLU provides better gradient propagation compared to sigmoid. Since ReLU only introduces non-linearity for positive inputs, the gradients are not affected by the saturation problem encountered in sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facilitates Sparse Representations: ReLU tends to produce more sparse representations compared to sigmoid. Sparse representations can be beneficial in reducing overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the model."
